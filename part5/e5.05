Platform comparison: arguments for why OpenShift is better than Rancher

- both OpenShift and Rancher offer features such as an UI, a CLI and authentication and access control
added on top of Kubernetes. Furthermore, both offer hybrid and multi-cloud strategies and
thus being able to manage many clusters centrally
- OpenShift is built on Red Hat's Linux environment (RHEL). Some favor RHEL because of its reliability, wide adoption
and security (SELinux and security certifications). Furthermore, OKD, the upstream project of OpenShift, is an open-source version of OpenShift
that doesn't have all the benefits of a subscription (like validated middleware and support), but is free.
Rancher works with any Linux distribution, and RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) runs within Docker containers.
Use of Rancher is free and use of OpenShift requires a subscription, but OpenShift might be better suited for enterprise applications
because of its security features
- OpenShift's major asset is the S2I, source-to-image toolkit for building container images out of source code
